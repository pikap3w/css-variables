CSS Variables

Advantages over LESS & SASS

1. No transpiling (native to the browser)
2. Have access to the DOM:
    - local scopes
        - can create variables that only work in certain section of app
    - change with javascript
        - ex. if you want users to be able to change font size
    - ideal for responsiveness
        - ex. can change variables with media queries
3. Perfect for themes
    - in particular, component specific themes for items you want to change a little bit
        - ex. a product after it is added to a shopping cart
        - ex. an article you want to feature

note about font size & em:
    - 16px browser default
    - em is a % applied to font size inherited from ancestor
